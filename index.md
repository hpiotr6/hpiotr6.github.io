# [Customer Clustering](https://github.com/hpiotr6/Customers-Clustering)

Project is the solution for eCommerce business assignment.
Having been given users, sessions, deliveries and products frames, we have to deal with the following business problem:

> We do have additional benefits for our best customers, but maybe it would be possible to find out who is potentially willing to spend more with us?

Project covers:
* Explanatory data analysis
* Customer segmentation models proposals
* ML Pipelines
* Microservice deployment

More information was reported in the polish language [here](https://github.com/hpiotr6/Customers-Clustering/blob/main/notebooks/etap2/etap2.ipynb).

* **Python libraries used:** pandas, sklearn, seaborn, log, click, pickle, numpy, fastapi, pydantic, pytest
* **Input:** users, sessions, deliveries and products frames
* **Output:** best clients group

# [Naive Bayes Random Forest Classifier](https://github.com/hpiotr6/Naive-Bayes-Random-Forest)

The project is a Random Forest from-scratch implementation, which relies on a Naive Bayes classifiers instead of decision trees.

Project covers:
* Random Forest implementation
* Naive Bayes implemenatation
* Comparison between `sklearn` Random Forest and own implementation

More information was reported in the polish language [here](https://github.com/hpiotr6/Naive-Bayes-Random-Forest/blob/main/21ZUMA_sprawozdanie_koncowe_Hondra_Groszyk.pdf).

# [Object tracking](https://github.com/hpiotr6/Object-Tracking)

Tracker is a Python library for multiple object tracking, i.e. vehicles, based on cartesian plane coordinates. Kalman Filter was used, incorporating three main steps:
* Prediction of object's future location
* Reduction of noise introduced by inaccurate detections
* Facilitating the process of association of multiple objects to their tracks
